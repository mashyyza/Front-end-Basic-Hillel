        <td><h1> Helping animals</h1></td>  
    <p>It is very difficult to watch how cruel people are to animals. Of course not all, but a lot. Unfortunately, animals can not protect themselves, they cannot earn for themselves food and shelter. Therefore, we, the people, should help them in this. Those who have all the possibilities. Especially in such a difficult time, I would like to appeal to everyone not to forget to feed the homeless animals, well, at least not to harm them, not to take away their life and health. Animals are very important in our life. Today I want to tell you about people and organizations who think, about safe life and help animals. They are very strong people. I admire them. 
        <br/>Here are some of them:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>BO "Dim Sirka";</li>
    <li>Plushka;</li>
    <li>I love animals.</li>
   </ol>
